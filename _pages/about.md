I am a third year Ph.D. student in [Jinan University](https://www.jnu.edu.cn/main.htm) , and currently visiting in [University of Mannheim](https://www.vwl.uni-mannheim.de/).

My research interests are International Trade and Labor Economics. Firstly, l focus on the effects of trade reform on China's labor market power,  including the dynamics of labor migration and wage markdown. Secondly, l focus on how the household policy impact the China's labor force, covering aspects such as skill spillover, the accumulation of human capital and migration.

I aim to find a postdoctoral position in 2025. You can find my CV here: [Lishuang's Curriculum Vitae](assets/CV2024_lishuang.pdf)
