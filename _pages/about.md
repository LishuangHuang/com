My research interests are international Trade and Labor Economics. Firstly, l focus on the effectsof trade reform on China's labor market power, including the dynamics of labor migration andwage markdown. Secondly, l focus on how the household policy impact on China's labor force,covering aspects such as skill spillover, the accumulation of human capital and migration.
