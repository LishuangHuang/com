* Trade Liberization and Labor Market Power: Evidence form Chian
  * GWe find evidence of labor market monopsony power from 1998 to 2007 in the Chinese labor market, with an average wage markdown of 1.186. There is a declining trend in average markdown rates over time. Import competition exposure is associated with increased labor market concentration, while trade liberalization improves employment and wages but reduces the number of firms. If a firm wishes to attract 1 percent of its local competitors' current employment, it would need to increase its wage premium by 0.5106 percent. Similarly, if a market desires to attract 1 percent of its local competitors' current employment, it would have to raise its wage premium by 1.1993 percent, indicating that labor mobility across markets requires higher wage compensation.

* Household Registration Constraints, Skill Training, and Integration of Migrants
  * Based on data such as the China Labor Dynamics Survey from 2012 to 2018, this paper takes the 2014 reform of the household registration system as a quasi-natural experiment to empirically analyze the impact of the demand for settlement by mobile populations on participation in training, as well as the impact of training, including settlement motivations, on labor market performance and social integration. The results show that after the reform of the household registration system, the probability of participation in training by mobile populations has significantly increased, with an increase of about three times that of local residents. In cities with higher settlement thresholds, the probability of participation in training by mobile populations is higher, and self-funding for training is more likely. Moreover, mobile populations with educational levels of college or below and aged 40 and below are more likely to participate in training. These findings validate the settlement motivations of mobile populations in participating in training. Training can increase individual income, but compared to local residents, the increase in income for mobile populations due to training for settlement is smaller, with lower skill matching and weaker externalities on the labor market. However, training contributes to the social integration of mobile populations in their destination areas.
